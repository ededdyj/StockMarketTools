# Personal Financial Dashboard

This is a personal project inspired by Investors Grow. The dashboard fetches financial data for a given stock ticker using the yfinance API, computes a simple fair value using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, and displays interactive charts.

## Features
- Stock information display (using yfinance)
- Interactive price history chart (using Plotly)
- Free cash flow chart
- Simple fair value calculation (DCF-based)

## Installation

2. Install the dependencies:
